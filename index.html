        <p>I am an <strong>incoming fourth-year Computer Science student</strong>. If I'm being honest, I have learned absolutely nothing substantial in my last three years in college. Thus, I am cramming as many <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>
          courses as I can during this summer break (I got them at incredible discounted prices, by the way). I am hoping to pursue a career in web development, software developmemnt, mobile development, or data science.</p>
